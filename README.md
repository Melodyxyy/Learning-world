# Learning-world
This learning platform is built using React for the frontend, with Node.js and Express.js serving as the backend frameworks. React Router handles page navigation, while React Context API manages state. The user authentication system utilizes a custom context created with Context API, offering features like login, logout, and registration.

# Key Points:

Frontend:

React: Builds the user interface with a focus on component-based development.
React Router: Manages frontend routing, supporting navigation between pages and handling route parameters.
CSS: Implements responsive design using media queries for optimal user experience across devices.
Backend:

Node.js: Executes on the server side, leveraging JavaScript for high-performance network applications.
Express.js: A web application framework simplifying server-side development.
RESTful API: Adopts a RESTful API architecture for smooth data interaction between frontend and backend.
Authentication:

React Context API: Creates a custom authentication context for global state management.
Token-based Authentication: Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure user authentication.
Data Management:

React Hooks: Manages component state and lifecycle using hooks such as useState and useEffect.
Axios: Facilitates HTTP communication between frontend and backend, handling data retrieval and sending.
Other Features:

Course Recommendations: Recommends relevant courses based on user learning history or interests.
Creator Page: Displays all courses created by the user.
Statistics: Provides total course count, registered user count, and other statistics on the homepage.
Tools:

Webpack: Packs frontend resources.
Babel: Transforms the latest JavaScript code into browser-compatible code.
Version Control:

Git: Utilizes Git for version control, with all source code and project files available on GitHub.
Deployment:

Heroku: Can be deployed on platforms like Heroku for internet accessibility.
